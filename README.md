# Computation-of-2D-and-3D-high-order-discrete-orthogonal-moments
 The content of this repository is related to the project that helps eliminate numerical instability and high-order orthogonal moment calculation error while preserving it's orthogonality, which is one of the most important properties of these types of functions.
### Kernel computation of discrete moments

The high-order orthogonal polynomial base causes a numerical instability that makes it difficult to calculate the moments. In this project, we analyze the calculation of the following discrete orthogonal polynomials,
  
* Tchebycheff polynomials
* Krawtchouk polynomials
* Hahn polynomials
* Meixner polynomials
* Charlier polynomials
  
The source codes of the project are described in the chapter "Computation of 2D and 3D high-order discrete orthogonal moments" of the book "Recent Progress in Moments and Moment Invariants" GCSR Volume 7 Edited by Dr. George A. Papakostas.
