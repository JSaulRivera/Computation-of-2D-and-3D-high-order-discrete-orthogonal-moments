# Computation-of-2D-and-3D-high-order-discrete-orthogonal-moments
 The content of this repository is related to the project that helps eliminate numerical instability and high-order orthogonal moment computation error.
 
### Kernel computation of discrete moments

The high-order orthogonal polynomial base causes a numerical instability that makes it difficult to calculate the moments. In this project, we analyze the calculation of the following discrete orthogonal polynomials,
  
-Tchebycheff polynomials
-Krawtchouk polynomials
-Hahn polynomials
-Meixner polynomials
-Charlier polynomials
  
The source codes of the project are described in the chapter "Computation of 2D and 3D high-order discrete orthogonal moments" of the book "Recent Progress in Moments and Moment Invariants" Edited by Dr. George A. Papakostas. For this reason, the codes will be published after the book is published.
